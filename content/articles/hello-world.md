I thought it was okay to just sit down at my desk, open my laptop, take a task from my To-Do list, and code until I felt tired.
But in reality, this style of work always killed my productivity level after 2–4 hours of coding.
I felt so tired that I did NOT want to do anything except different low energy tasks ( Like Code Review )
Today I can code 8+ hours without like crap after.
WHAT HAS CHANGED 🤔? YOU MAY ASK ME.
MY APPROACH TO WORK 🛵
I have created a productivity system 🪐 that helps me to code, write, create and live at my maximum capabilities without getting boring, tiredness, or being fog.
My productivity system stays on 3 main pillars:
Schedule
TO-DO for tomorrow
System 69!
Let’s look closer at each of them
📆 Schedule
Everything starts with a schedule. What, where, and when I do.
My schedule looks like this:
7 AM to 8:30 AM: Meditation, Sport, Shower.
8:30 AM to 9:00 AM: Breakfast.
9:00 AM to 12:00 PM: My 3 hours programming time.
12:00 PM to 1:00 PM: Lunch and go out walking for 15–20 minutes.
1:00 PM to 6:00/7:00/8:00 PM: My Next hours for coding.
8:00 to 9:00 PM: Family Time, Watch a movie or something.
DO NOT FORGET TO SLEEP 8 HOURS A DAY.
YOUR BRAIN NEEDS TO COLLECT THE GARBAGE AND RID OF THEM.
🗺 To-Do for Tomorrow
My To-Do list is simple. I use a plain paper notebook to make it and Notion digital copy.
I create my To-Do list in the evening for tomorrow day.
I create my To-Do list for tomorrow, and not in the morning because it saves my productivity time and my energy attention.
🚦System 69
When I started coding I did it like this:
Open laptop 👉 Open code editor 👉 Pick a task 👉 code until I feel tired 👉 take a break ( Meditate or walking for 5 minutes / spending time on social media ).
Yup!
Until I read about Pomodoro. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method when you break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Do You Code 8 hours a day?
