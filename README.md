# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repository where I host code and content of [my website](https://hmogni.me), I have adopted a file-based CMS approach to my website, meaning that all of the website's contents is stored as Markdown files in this repository.

Once I merge an article in the main branch it gets published on the website (a Vercel deployement).

I have used the following tools to create my website:

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [NuxtJS Content Module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)

I also used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy my website.
